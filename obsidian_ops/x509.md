**Команда x509**<br>
openssl-x509 - Certificate display and signing command<br>
This command is a multi-purposes certificate handling command. It can be used to print certificate information, convert certificates to various forms, edit certificate trust settings, generate certificates from scratch or from certificating requests and then self-signing them or signing them like a "micro CA".<br>

**-in**<br>
[filename|uri] - This specifies the input to read a certificate from or the input file for reading a certificate request if the -req flag is used. In both cases this defaults to standard input.<br>
**-noout**<br>
This option prevents output except for printing as requested by below options.<br>
**-text**<br>
Prints out the certificate in text form. Full details are printed including the public<br>
key, signature algorithms, issuer and subject names, serial number any extensions present<br>
and any trust settings.<br>
**-issuer**<br>
Print issuer name<br>
**-ext**<br>
Prints out the certificate extensions in text form. Extensions are specified with a comma separated string, e.g.,<br>
"subjectAltName,subjectKeyIdentifier". See the x509v3_config(5) manual page for the extension names.<br>
